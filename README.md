# Go Iris Web Server

This repo can be used as a starting point to deploy [Go](https://go.dev/) web applications on Render.

It is based on the [render-go-iris-web-server examples](https://github.com/render-examples/go-gin-web-server) example powered by the [Iris](https://github.com/kataras/iris) web framework.

The sample app is up at https://go-iris.onrender.com.
